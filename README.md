# Project JarvisIRL

## Overview
JarvisIRL is an artificial intelligence project aimed at creating a virtual assistant inspired by the concept of a human brain. The project utilizes neural network architecture to simulate various brain regions, each responsible for different functions such as processing sensory input, decision-making, memory storage, and action execution.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: JarvisIRL is designed with a modular architecture, where different brain regions are represented as individual neural networks, allowing for easy scalability and customization.
- **Memory Interaction**: The project incorporates a memory module that stores and retrieves past experiences, enabling the virtual assistant to learn and adapt over time.
- **User Interaction**: JarvisIRL interacts with users through various input methods such as voice commands, text queries, and sensor data.
- **Decision-Making**: Based on user input and past experiences stored in memory, JarvisIRL makes decisions to perform specific actions or provide relevant responses.
- **Error Handling and Safety**: The virtual assistant implements mechanisms for error handling and ensuring safety, minimizing the risk of harmful actions.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The virtual assistant continuously learns from interactions, feedback, and environmental data, improving its performance and accuracy over time.
